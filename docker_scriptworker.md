Scriptworker Docker Deployment
==============================

We've been discussing this for a while; it seems the current consensus is everything should be in a single docker image (scriptworker, the script, creds+secrets) for easier scalability and deployment by another team like CloudOps.

Largely based on Johan's [Make Scriptworker Development Easy Enough doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nxlPJAqzWVmEH6xS8d9LCgfNkpUIu13J_4tR9P-0bH0/edit?pli=1)
